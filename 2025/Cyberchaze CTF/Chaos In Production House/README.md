# Chaos In Production House

## Description
```
One of our clients operates a warehouse with a new conveyor belt system to automate distribution of equipment storage. One of their operators, who was responsible for process and network device configurations, created an Android application to improve remote access and control of the production environment.

Help us to analyze this application and the supporting cloud services to determine if we should be using this in production.
