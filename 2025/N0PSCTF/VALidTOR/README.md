# VALidTOR

## Description
```
Jojo has finally triangulated n00psy’s SOS signal... and it’s emanating from a very cranky pink flip-phone running an equally cranky Android app.

Inside the handset lurks VALidATOR, a gatekeeper who refuses to let anyone decipher Noopsy’s voicemail unless you whisper the one valid integer into its single, lonely text box. Legend says the number untangles a knot of modular riddles that the three evil Lords have etched.
